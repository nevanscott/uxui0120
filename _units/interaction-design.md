title: Interaction Design
order: 2
description: |
  We will learn the fundamentals of interface and interaction design, borrowing from general visual design basics, and focusing specifically on their application in screen-based interfaces. This unit is especially practice-oriented, as the goal is to become more comfortable and familiar with design tools to prototype interfaces, and to develop usable and appealing designs by exploring the design space thoroughly.
