title: Mobile Design
order: 2
description: >-
  We will learn the fundamentals of interface and interaction design, borrowing
  from general visual design basics, and focusing specifically on their
  application in mobile screen-based interfaces. This unit is especially
  practice-oriented, as the goal is to become more comfortable and familiar with
  design tools to prototype interfaces, and to develop usable and appealing
  designs by exploring the design space thoroughly.
