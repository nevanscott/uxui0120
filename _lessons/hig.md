  We'll focus on Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for iOS (phones and tablets) for now, with an emphasis on the navigation models in iOS.
objectives:
  - describe the purpose of Apple's Human Interface Guidelines
  - identify hierarchical vs. flat navigational patterns in iOS apps
  - identify when to use [Navigation Bars][], [Tab Bars][], and [Toolbars][]
  - identify features of an app which follow and violate guidelines.

Where to start
--------------

The HIG is... detailed. You're not going to read through it all in one go. Here's where I recommend starting:

- [Interface Essentials](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/overview/interface-essentials/)
- [Navigation](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/app-architecture/navigation/)
- [Navigation Bars][], [Tab Bars][], [Toolbars][]
- [Gestures](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/user-interaction/gestures/)
- [Color](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/color/)

[Navigation Bars]: https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/bars/navigation-bars/
[Tab Bars]: https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/bars/tab-bars/
[Toolbars]: https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/bars/toolbars/
