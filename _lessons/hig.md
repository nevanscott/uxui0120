Where to start
--------------

The HIG is... detailed. You're not going to read through it all in one go. Here's where I recommend starting:

- [Interface Essentials](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/overview/interface-essentials/)
- [Navigation](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/app-architecture/navigation/)
- [Navigation Bars][], [Tab Bars][], [Toolbars][]
- [Gestures](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/user-interaction/gestures/)
- [Color](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/color/)
