description: >-
  Visual design aims to improve the user experience through the use of layouts,
  colors, typography and other visual elements. It's important to start thinking
  about how to approach this process and the tools we can use. In this class, we
  will use Sketch as our primary tool for visual design.
objectives:
  - 'Use artboards, layers, and the inspector in Sketch'
  - 'Create boxes and text, with alignments'
  - Use Anima plugin to create stacks (horizontal and vertical)
  - Use a few important keyboard shortcuts to speed up your work
  - Create an interface mockup at medium fidelity
  - Use duplicate liberally to keep track of your work as you go

Today we'll aim to take a light ramp into getting started working with Sketch to make medium-fidelity prototypes. Familiarity with Sketch on its own will not make you a better visual designer, but facility with Sketch should allow you to more quickly mock up designs and iterate faster so that you can consider more options before landing on a final design.

Our goal for today is to simply start that journey.
