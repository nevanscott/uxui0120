As a new designer, it is not expected that you recreate the wheel, but rather pull inspiration from existing sources - both to train your designer's eye and to speed up your workflow.

It is also critical that you know how to encapsulate and communicate the visual essence of a digital brand in order to align stakeholders, clients, and coworkers with the visual style.

In addition, we will discuss why it is important to stretch your design in order to consider the users' whole experience rather than just the ideal states and explore how to design for these different scenarios.
