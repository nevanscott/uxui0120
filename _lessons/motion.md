unit: 2

topics:

description: |
  Motion should be used to add clarity to a user interface, and then sparingly and with nuance. A little bit goes a long way.
objectives:
  - define "state" in the context of a user interface
  - describe how the effect of animation is created on screens
  - differentiate between animation sequences (like cartoons) and animation in interfaces (state transitions)
  - create an animated transition in Principle
  - animate a screen element in Principle imported from Sketch
  - list examples of properties with can be animated in interfaces
  - differentiate between system- and user-triggered state changes
  - define "easing" in the context of an animation transition
