title: Design Process
unit: 1
day: 1
topics:
  - Design Thinking
  - Design Process
  - Double Diamond
description: >
  In this course, we'll take an iterative approach to design. No one "process"
  fits all projects. However,  we'll find it useful to alternate between
  *divergent* (exploratory) and *convergent* (decisive) thinking, and to find
  ways to test ideas efficiently to gain confidence in our decisions.
objectives:
  - outline the 5 parts of the d.school design thinking process
  - describe the double diamond process model
  - explain why it's important to identify problems before devising solutions
resources:
  - 'An Introduction to Design Thinking: Process Guide'
  - 'The Double Diamond: Strategy + Execution of the Right Solution'
  - A study of the design process
