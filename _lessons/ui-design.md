unit: 2
day: 18
topics:
  - Color
  - User Interface
  - Microcopy
description: >
  Exploration is key to creating beautiful user interfaces. We don't see design
  in our mind, we perceive it with our eyes, and interact with it with our
  hands. Until a possibility is down on paper or screen, it's not a possibility
  you've considered. Give yourself as many possibilities to choose from as you
  can.
objectives:
  - >-
    establish a basic color palette with a primary color and a bank of neutral
    colors
  - check for appropriate contrast between text and background colors
  - design user interface elements using a layered approach
  - use symbols in Sketch to make reusable UI components
  - translate a low-fidelity sketch/wireframe into a high-fidelity UI mockup
  - identify appropriate user interface elements for given user tasks
  - describe what microcopy is and its role in interface design
