        title: How we read
        body: |
          * We read in **saccades**: our eyes jump along each line making impressions.
          * Then our brain **stitches those impressions together** to form an image.
          * If we misunderstand something, we are pretty sophisticated at jumping back to a previous position to **try again**.
          * At the end of a line, we have to **jump back** to the beginning of the **next line**, which is **more work** than the other jumps and also more **error-prone**.
