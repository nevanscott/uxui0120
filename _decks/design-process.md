title: Design Process
day: 1

objectives:
  - outline the 5 parts of the d.school design thinking process
  - describe the double diamond process model
  - explain why it's important to identify problems before devising solutions

  - title: What is design anyway?

        title: What kind of design work are we talking about?
        body: |
          * Interaction design
          * Interface design
          * Information design
          * Experience design
          * Service design

        title: Stay organized
        body: |
          Design work tends to be complicated. It's important to make sure we're covering everything we hope to accomplish with a design, and to focus our attention on the right things as we do our work.
      -
        title: Keep the user in mind
        body: |
          It's easy to get lost in our own ideas and forget about the people we are designing for along the way. Having a process in place puts guard rails to keep us honest.
      -
        title: Inform and include others
        body: |
          User-centered design, while accessible as a field, is not everyone's expertise or focus of concern. Being clear about our process, goals, and priorities helps us keep other people on our teams informed about what is going on and why. It also helps us find ways to include them in the process to improve the quality of our work and the level of organizational buy-in.

        title: The "steps"
        body: |
          1. Empathize
          2. Define
          3. Ideate
          4. Prototype
          5. Test

        title: 1. Empathize
        body: |
          It can't be a **"user-centered" design process** if we don't deliberately incorporate an understanding of people and their needs into our process.
      -
        title: 2. Define
        body: |
          Set a **goal** to work toward. Often this takes the form of a **problem** we are trying to address.

          A goal helps us focus our work and evaluate the quality of the work as we go and when we're done.
      -
        title: 3. Ideate
        body: |
          With a clearly-defined goal, we start to **brainstorm** possible ways to reach that goal.
      -
        title: 4. Prototype
        body: |
          We decide on one or more of our ideas to move forward with and create something we can use to test the concept.

          In the case of digital products, this typically takes the form of a paper prototype or a clickable prototype.
      -
        title: 5. Test
        body: |
          Prototype in hand, we devise a way to test the prototype with real people, in ways that validate the quality of the prototype against our goals.
      -
        title: "Bonus: Iterate"
        body: |
          This is intended to be an **iterative** process.

          * If the *test* shows some weak points in the *prototype*, go back and make changes.
          * If your goals are difficult to *define*, take a step back and consider doing more activities to *empathize*.

        title: How to empathize?
        activity:
          -
            duration: 1
            direction: Write down as many ways you can think of to better empathize with users and their problems.
          -
            duration: 2
            direction: Turn to your neighbor and discuss what you both wrote down.
          -
            duration: 5
            direction: Share out what you discussed with the class.

        title: The "four Ds"
        body: |
          Similar to the five steps of the d.school model, but broken down into four instead:

          1. Discover
          2. Define
          3. Develop
          4. Deliver
      -
        title: Diverge and converge
        body: |
          These two modes, **divergent** and **convergent**, are probably the most powerful ways of thinking about our work as designers that we will discuss in this entire course.
