Tik tok, time flies! We're almost at the end of week 4. 

For today practice we will be translating [Apple iOS Alarm](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J8dT4WiQbE5JWhwqzfplsYzmk1JbZdV_) to Material Design. Set the timer to 30 minutes and go! Pay attention to details, navigation and tabs... 

Once you're done, upload your file [in this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J8dT4WiQbE5JWhwqzfplsYzmk1JbZdV_). 

Best of luck!
