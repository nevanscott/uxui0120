Continuing with the Pick a Screen Contestâ€¦ Pick a Screen, again (x2)! 

It can be from the same project you worked on last week or even the same screen. And you know the drill, set the timer to 30 minutes and improve it!

Once you have finished, upload a screenshot in this [slide deck](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1up9Y-ttQC4swlZZHkRwnMXtxpVyyE0oR).

But wait, don't leave! There's something else... once you have finished and uploaded your project, check [yesterday's slide deck](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18RdxQCQBQ-QxH4AneTVMWGBNJFbBWvbQ) and pick a screen from one of your peers and add a comment on their improvement ðŸš€
