Good evening guys!

Today, we'll continue working on variations, and this time, it will be with cactus!

Open [this file](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dQnAW7u_mYMBWctadatUeccBV-dhGc1T), set the timer for 30 minutes and spend 15 minutes on each proposal. Be bold! Try things out! Typeface, color, layout... Everything!

Once you have finished, upload [the file here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dQnAW7u_mYMBWctadatUeccBV-dhGc1T).
