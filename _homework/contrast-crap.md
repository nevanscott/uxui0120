Hi again guys!

During this week, we will be reviewing the **CRAP principles**. Yeah, CRAP!! (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment and Position). 

Today's exercise is all about **Contrast**. In [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17Y3PFdG7-Y5hHSIkyX4SbQRuvrcC4A6S), you'll find a Sketch file with 3 screenshot of real examples with (possible) bad contrast. Use the [Contrast Checker](https://contrastchecker.com/) tool to check the accessibility of them colors and create a recommended alternative to the existing one. 

When you're done, upload your file in [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17Y3PFdG7-Y5hHSIkyX4SbQRuvrcC4A6S). 

So... Get ready, set the timer to 30 minutes and go!
