unit: 3
assigned: 25
due: 26
---

In order to start reflecting on your evolution through this Bootcamp, please

1. Reread [The 8 competencies of user experience: a tool for assessing and developing UX Practitioners](https://www.userfocus.co.uk/articles/8-competencies-of-user-experience.html) by David Travis
2. Fill out the provided [UX Competencies Map](https://www.userfocus.co.uk/pdf/competency-map.pdf)
3. Reflect on and write down your
  - career goals,
  - areas where you see yourself developing strengths,
  - and areas where you feel you need the most improvement

This will be the second self-assessment that you do. Remember that the purpose is to establish a baseline understanding of where you are and set some goals for the rest of the class, with an eye toward your career development.

The main purpose of this exercise is your personal growth as a designer, not on project-level but towards a more general skill set base. Remember that by reading your post, we should be able to understand the justification of your self-assessment as if we were in a meeting (be clear but still concise!)
