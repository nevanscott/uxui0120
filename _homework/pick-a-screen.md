During this past 6 weeks, we have learned... a LOT! 

Now it's time to show how much we have improved! Pick a screen from one of your past projects you want to improve, set a timer to 30 minutes and go! 

Once you have finished, upload a screenshot in this [slide deck](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BmhK_xfJWdTr7AATULLzl5HOAmIoOC8P).
