Hi Guys,

Since you are working on variations and CRAP this week. This screen shot of Tody (A to-do for managing household cleaning routines.) is the perfect practice. 

Look closely what can you improve about the CRAP and try to come up with at least one variation that looks visually appealing while being in-line with CRAP.
