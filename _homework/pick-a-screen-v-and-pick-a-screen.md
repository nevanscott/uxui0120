We'll finish with the Pick a Screen Contestâ€¦ So... Pick a Screen, Pick a Screen and Pick a Screen! 

To improve a screen, pick the one you like the most! It can be from the same project you worked on last week or even the same screen. Set the timer to 1 hour and improve it!

Once you have finished, upload a screenshot in this [slide deck](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MqtU-jlpubLVagYgS-w0RVIu31MoVGlh).

Once you have finished and uploaded your project, check [Monday's slide deck](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1up9Y-ttQC4swlZZHkRwnMXtxpVyyE0oR) and pick a screen from one of your peers and add a comment on their improvement. 

And the final pick a screen! Pick the variation you liked the most and put it in this [slide deck](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H3bc4Tcn10SVjOIIdsEVq2jQemReqAJ7), on Monday morning we'll do a Pick a Screen "Show and Tell" version so you can get live feedback from us! But remember, you will only be able to participate if you participated to each day of the contest! 



Food luck!
