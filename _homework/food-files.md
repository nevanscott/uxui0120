Hi guys!

Today, we're going to practice variations (with pancakes!). To do so, you'll need some fuel, so get something to eat and get ready (you will thank me later :)). 

Ready? Nice! Open [this file](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-CLntenWBWcQzBI9D5TvPuTyHO1CHEMI) and prepare yourself. This time you will have to set the timer for 30 minutes, but you will be spending **10 minutes** for each of the variations, and you guessed right! You will have to upload a final file with **3 variations of the pancakes recipe**. Try changing colors, layout, typefaces, everything! 

Once you're done, upload the file to [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-CLntenWBWcQzBI9D5TvPuTyHO1CHEMI). 

And.. Buen provecho :)
