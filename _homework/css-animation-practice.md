Our photographer friend is happy with what we have, but he wants you to experiment a little more so why don't we apply animations to the website?

Check the documentation from MDN and CSS Tricks and create some fun animations for the website. Let's create the first one together:

## Steps

1. Open with your code editor the wedding practice folder
2. We'll be animating the first picture, the one that is actually a link. In order to do that let's create a class for the img tag using `class="main-picture"`
3. We want that when we hover over the picture it gets bigger and its opacity changes a bit. To do that we need to state our initial width, that is 650px.
4. Now let's create another selector that refers to that class but only when hovering.
5. Write inside that you want the width to be 700px when on hover. Check if it works!
6. Now, let's play with the opacity and give it a value of .80.
7. If you check the transition you'll see that is a little sudden. To make it more smooth let's say to the .main-picture selector that when a transition occurs, the duration has to be 1 second.
8. Check the result and find at least two other animations to apply!
