Hey!

Do you have vacation in your mind? If so, we have the perfect weekend homework assignment for you! üå¥üçπPrepare your suitcase because, we're visiting **Airbnb**. Yeah! Nice apartments, experiences, but... CRAP! Did they forget something? 

Check [this file](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tNgaowPZSjGpmiOBmt-pRB0k35MG8VA4) and analyze what's wrong. Please, be **specific**! Which **CRAP** principle is not applied? What can be better?

Once you write this down in the Sketch file, propose a better solution. Since we all like nice apartments, let's do it in **High Fidelity** (yes, with pictures and everything!) and, create **nested symbols** to make your life easier. 

Since no one wants the vacations to finish we'll have to time-box ourself... This time, for 1 hour. 

Are you done? Add the files to [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tNgaowPZSjGpmiOBmt-pRB0k35MG8VA4) and grab a mojito!
