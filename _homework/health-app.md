Here you have a new opportunity to put in practice your sketch skills. This time you'll have to make a copy of the screenshot of a health app. Try to do as much as you can in 30 min. The goal of this exercise is to keep the layers organized and named.

You can find the screenshot [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19A-orua_ij-jJG7OFMKv4UtpzkWvMTSj).

When you finished, upload your sketch file [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19A-orua_ij-jJG7OFMKv4UtpzkWvMTSj), in the folder with your name.
