Write a report about your [Native Mobile app]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _projects/native-mobile.md %}). This may be similar to a written version of your presentation, but you'll have the opportunity to go into more detail.

In the next days, bring this with you to your 1-on-1 with one of the TAs, to review the project with them.
